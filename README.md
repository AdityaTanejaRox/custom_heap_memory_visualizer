Heap Visualizer ðŸ§ 
This is a Python-based memory visualizer that animates heap allocation and deallocation events, showing memory blocks, fragmentation, and coalescing in real time.

Used as a debugging + teaching aid alongside custom C++ memory allocators.

*This project does not include the C++ allocator source code.

Features:

Visualizes memory allocation in a heap layout

Distinguishes free, used, and coalesced blocks

Shows heap stats (used/free mem, block counts)

Hover to toggle between raw size and human-readable format

Built-in launcher for selecting test snapshots

Cool UI :p
